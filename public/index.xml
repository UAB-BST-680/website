      <description>Class: Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. Before class, you are expected to complete primers and readings that will introduce you to the material. At the beginning of class, I will give a brief lecture usually lasting less than 20 minutes. After the lecture, we will break out into groups and work on problems that let you apply the content we are learning. I think many students prefer to learn programming by doing, so most classes will involve programming exercises.</description>
